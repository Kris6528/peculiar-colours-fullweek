:bf:boop beep?
:dadC:transform..?..what do you- oh...
:dadD:how do i say this..i don't have any transformation...i'm not like mr.whitty or that church lady.
:dadD:my only powers are seeing ghosts and traveling to other dimensions.
:dadD:but now that I think about it... it's more of a curse.
:dadnull2:i know these powers are technically special, but when they've been passed down for generations it's kinda to be expected y'know?
:dadnull2:plus, it's not fun having ghosts... or other things...following you everywhere.
:dadnull2:i grew up in a cult.. i don't want them to use my powers for evil. i have to get out of here as soon as my cousin gets out of the shop.
:bf:beep?
:gf:yeah..what dimensions? ghosts? cults??
:dadE:w-wait! ignore all of what i just said!
